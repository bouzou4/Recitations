Researchers from Oxford University recently published a study in Biological 
Letters showing how one type of spider manages to spin silk that is imbued 
with static electricity. The spider, Uloborus plumipes, better known as the 
garden center spider, spins incredibly fine nano-filaments of silk that carry a 
small electric charge. The spider shoots the silk out of tiny spigots on a unique 
organ called the cribellum; you can see what they look like in the picture 
below.
